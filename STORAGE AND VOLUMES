"Copy on write" means: everyone has a single shared copy of the same data until it's written, and then a copy is made.

                  Common file
                  
           Program 1       Program 2
           
           
  docker info #to check the storage driver
  
  cd /var/lib/docker
  ls  -l
  you can see the overlay2
  
  cd overlay2
  ls -l
  cd l
  ls
  
  docker images
  docker pull ubuntu
  cd ..
  ls -l
  
  you can see multiple directories
