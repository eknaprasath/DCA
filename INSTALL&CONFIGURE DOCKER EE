DOCKER UNIVERSAL CONTROL PLANE (UCP)

Docker UCP is the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker.
UCP help you manage your Docker cluster and applications through a single interface.

UCP Architecture.

Universal Control Plane is a containerized application that runs on Docker EE.
Once Universal Control Plane (UCP) instance id deployed, developers and IT operations no longer interact 
  with Docker Engine directly, but interact with UCP instead.
  
System Requirements for UCP

Minimum Requirements for UCP:

* Docker EE engine.
* 8GB of RAM for Manager Nodes
* 4GB of RAM for Worker nodes
* 5 GB of free disk space for the /var partition for manager nodes
* 500MB of free disk space for the /var partiton for worker nodes
