Docker containers can have security vulnerabilites
If blindly pulled and if containers are running in production, it can result in breach.

DTR allows us to perform security scan for the containers.
These scan can perform "On Push" or even manually


CONFIGURE CONTAINER SCANNING WITH DTR

Enable the vulnerability scanning features and try with pushing the image to repo

OVERVIEW OF UCP CLIENT BUNDLES

  A client bundle is a group of certificates downloadable directly from the Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP)
  
  Depending on the permission associated with the user, you can now execute docker swarm commands from your remote machine that take effect on the remote cluster
  
For example:

  * You can create a new service in UCP from your laptop.
  * Login to remote container from your laptop without SSH (Via API)
