Docker containers can have security vulnerabilites
If blindly pulled and if containers are running in production, it can result in breach.

DTR allows us to perform security scan for the containers.
These scan can perform "On Push" or even manually


CONFIGURE CONTAINER SCANNING WITH DTR

Enable the vulnerability scanning features and try with pushing the image to repo

OVERVIEW OF UCP CLIENT BUNDLES

  A client bundle is a group of certificates downloadable directly from the Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP)
  
  Depending on the permission associated with the user, you can now execute docker swarm commands from your remote machine that take effect on the remote cluster
  
For example:

  * You can create a new service in UCP from your laptop.
  * Login to remote container from your laptop without SSH (Via API)
  

UCP Client bundle is associated with user so we can find them from -> my profile
create a new bundle and download the bundle

launch a container

docker container run -it -dt --name myubuntu ubuntu bash

docker ps
docker cp "ucp-bundle-admin.zip" myubuntu:/tmp

docker container exec -it myubuntu bash
cd /
mkdir /ucp
cp /tmp/ucp-bundle-admin.zip /ucp
apt-get update
apt-get install unzip

unzip ucp-bundle-admin
nano env.sh


eval "$(<env.sh)"

to verify 
echo $DOCKER_HOST

curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

docker service create --name mydemoservice nginx

goto ucp gui and check for the created service

LINUX NAMESPACES

Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated work space called the container
The namespaces provide a layer of isolation. Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.

Namespace A                         Namespace B
UTS PID                             UTS   PID

docker container run -dt --name mybusybox busybox sh
docker ps
ps -ef

docker container exec -it mybusybox bash

ps -ef 

unshare -fp --mount-proc /bin/bash

unshare --uts /bin/bash
hostname
hostname mynamespace

Currently Linux provides six different types of namespaces as follows:

* Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
* Process(PID)
* Network(net)
* User Id (user)
* Mount (mnt)
* UTS

CONTROL GROUPS (CGROUPS)
Control groups (cgroups) is a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage(CPU,memory,disk I/O, network, etc.)
of a collection of processes.
